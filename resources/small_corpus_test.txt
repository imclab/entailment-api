ABOUT 

Urban Aviary is an independent jewelry label creating pieces that are a modern take on "nature inspired", eco friendly, and conflict free. Urban aviary products are hand made, hand assembled, and hand picked by owner and designer, Samantha Bird, on the third floor of her urban studio in the USA. Featuring rough gemstones and designs that are fresh versions of your favorite trends, Urban Aviary's concepts are minimalistic yet energized and great for every day wear. Bird offers her jewelry on her web site and is often presented on popular flash sale sites where Urban Aviary designs are featured next to the hottest products on the market today. Adding new pieces every week, Urban Aviary keeps the online selection fresh and exciting.

PHILANTHROPISTS & ECO-FRIENDLY 

We are eco friendly & care about human rights! We are producing jewelry in a small one room studio, not a large factory. We used recycled materials and supplies when available, source suppliers with ethical and fair work facilities, use minimal amount of material (using only what is needed) and energy (working in the daylight) in the studio, ship with recycled product packaging and mailers (and we don't drive to the post office), use energy-efficient printers, and we recycle and upcycle materials in the studio. Our conflict free diamonds comply with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. 

10% of the proceeds from Urban Aviary purchases goes to charity. We support local and national charities that give to the many people in need whether it is food, clothing, a place to live, support to get back on their feet, and/or emergency funding. Each purchase from Urban Aviary adds a little more good to a city and world that needs it.

Shipping price ranges from 3.00 - 10.00 in the US depending on price of your item due to postal insurance and shipping costs.

>>> International Shipping 
We do ship internationally but we can not track international shipments. Therefore, if there is loss, we will not be able to replace your item. We are so sorry for this inconvenience, there is just no way to know what happens to it after it leaves the USA at our shipping price. If you are an international buyer and would like to purchase tracking, it will range from 45-90$ to do so at your cost. Please contact us if you'd like tracking.

Privacy 
No one will ever see your payment information because we use a third party payment system, PayPal. We will never misuse your address, e-mail address, or any other information we are given in order to get your purchase in your hands. We never keep your information unless you request to be added to our mailing list.

Security 
We use PayPal for payment. PayPal automatically encrypts your confidential information in transit from your computer to their computers using the Secure Sockets Layer protocol (SSL) with an encryption key length of 128-bits (the highest level commercially available). Before you even register or log in to the PayPal site, their server checks that you're using an approved browser - one that uses SSL 3.0 or higher. Once your information reaches the PayPal site, it resides on a server that is heavily guarded both physically and electronically. PayPal servers sit behind an electronic firewall and are not directly connected to the internet, so your private information is available only to authorized computers.

The Urban Aviary shop does not need to be a secure site, since you do not use it to pay directly. We are just a store front, you do not give us your payment information directly. Any information you share in the contact form is never saved or misused.
